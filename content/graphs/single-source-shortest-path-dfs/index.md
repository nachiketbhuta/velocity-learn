Given an undirected graph, find the distance between source vertex to all the other vertices in the graph.

Distance of a vertex can be defined as the number of edges between the source vertex and the destination vertex.

### Description

1. We will select a source vertex in the graph.
2. We will run a series of DFS in the graph.
3. The distance of the source vertex will be always $0$.
4. We will maintain a distance array which will hold the distance from source vertex to another vertex.
5. After visiting the source vertex, we further perform DFS for each adjacent vertex that we havenâ€™t visited before and update the distance for adjacent vertex to be the distance of source vertex + 1.

### Note

1. This algorithm only works when the given undirected graph is a tree i.e it follows the terminologies of a tree.
2. A graph $G$ can be a tree if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:

   * The number of connected components in $G$ is only $1$.
   * The number of edges in $G$ must be one less than the number of vertices i.e $(|E| = |V| - 1)$.

### Implementation

C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

const int maxN = 1000001;

vector<int> G[maxN];

// Visited array
bool visited[maxN];

// Stores the distances of the vertices
int dist[maxN];

void dfs(int u, int d = 0) {
	// Mark the current node as visited
	visited[u] = true;

	// Update the distance of current node
	dist[u] = d;

	// Explore all the adjacent nodes of current node
	for (int node : G[u])
		// If the adjacent node is not visited
		if (!visited[node])
			// Run DFS on the adjacent node
			// Distance between the current node and adjacent node:
			// Distance[adjacent] = Distance[current] + 1
			// cause there is a edge from current node to adjacent node
			dfs(node, dist[u] + 1);
}

int main() {
	int vertices, edges;
	cin >> vertices >> edges;

	for (int i = 0; i < edges; i++) {
		int a, b;
		cin >> a >> b;

		// Since it is an undirected graph, so we will update adjacency list of both nodes
		G[a].push_back(b);
		G[b].push_back(a);
	}

	// Source vertex
	int start = 1;

	// We will start the traversal from source vertex
	dfs(start);

	// Print all the distance from source vertex to all the vertices
	for (int i = 1; i <= vertices; ++i)
	{
		cout << "Distance from " << start << " to " << i << ": " << dist[i] << endl;
	}

	return 0;
}
```

Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SSSP {

	static class Vertex {
		public int id;
		public List<Vertex> edges;

		public Vertex(int id) {
			this.id = id;
		}
	}

	public static void dfs(int node, boolean[] visited, Vertex[] graph, int[] distance, int currentDistance) {
		// Mark the current node as visited
		visited[node] = true;

		// Update the distance of current node
		distance[node] = currentDistance;

		// Explore all the adjacent nodes of current node
		for (Vertex child : graph[node].edges) {
			// If the adjacent node is not visited
			if (!visited[child.id])
				// Run DFS on the adjacent node
				// Distance between the current node and adjacent node:
				// Distance[adjacent] = Distance[current] + 1
				// cause there is a edge from current node to adjacent node
				dfs(child.id, visited, graph, distance, distance[node] + 1);
		}
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int vertices = sc.nextInt();
		int edges = sc.nextInt();

		Vertex[] graph = new Vertex[vertices + 1];

		// Visited array
		boolean[] visited = new boolean[vertices + 1];

		// Stores the distances of the vertices
		int[] distance = new int[vertices + 1];

		for (int i = 1; i <= vertices; i++) {
			graph[i] = new Vertex(i);
			graph[i].edges = new ArrayList<Vertex>();
		}

		Vertex v1, v2;

		for (int i = 1; i <= edges; i++) {
			int a = sc.nextInt();
			int b = sc.nextInt();

			v1 = new Vertex(a);
			v2 = new Vertex(b);

			// Since it is an undirected graph, so we will update adjacency list of both nodes
			graph[a].edges.add(v2);
			graph[b].edges.add(v1);
		}

		// Initial Distance
		int currentDistance = 0;

		// Source vertex
		int start = 1;

		// We will start the traversal from source vertex
		dfs(start, visited, graph, distance, currentDistance);

		// Print all the distance from source vertex to all the vertices
		for (int i = 1; i <= vertices; i++) {
			System.out.println("Distance from " + start + " to " + i + ": " + distance[i]);
		}

		sc.close();
	}
}

Python

```python
maxN = 1000001

G = {}

# Visited array
visited = [False] * maxN

# Stores the distances of the vertices
distance = [0] * maxN

# Initializing the adjacency list
for i in range(maxN):
    G[i] = list()

def dfs(u, d = 0):
    # Mark the current node as visited
    visited[u] = True

    # Update the distance of current node
    distance[u] = d
    
    # Explore all the adjacent nodes of current node
    for node in G[u]:
        # If the adjacent node is not visited
        if visited[node] is False:
            # Run DFS on the adjacent node
            # Distance between the current node and adjacent node:
            # Distance[adjacent] = Distance[current] + 1 
            # cause there is a edge from current node to adjacent node
            dfs(node, distance[u] + 1)

vertices, edges = map(int, input().split())

for i in range(edges):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())

    # Since it is an undirected graph, so we will update adjacency list of both nodes
    G[a].append(b)
    G[b].append(a)

# Source vertex
start = 1

# We will start the traversal from source vertex
dfs(start)

# Print all the distance from source vertex to all the vertices
for i in range(1, vertices + 1):
    print(f"Distance from {start} to {i}: {distance[i]}")
```

### Time Complexity - $O(V+E)$

A simple DFS Traversal of the graph which is represented using adjacency list. So the time complexity is $O(V+E)$ where $V$ are the number of vertices and $E$ are the number of edges in the graph.

### Space Complexity - $O(V)$

To store the visited and distance array, $O(V)$ space is required.
